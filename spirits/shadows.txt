SHADOWS FLICKER LIKE FLAME
* Flavor
The Dahan say, “If the long shadows of sunset stretching beside you begin
to shift and flicker like tongues of hungry fire, do not run. That will only
feed your fear, and whet the shadows’ appetite.”
This spirit invokes an instinctive fear in humans, perhaps because it doesn’t
think at all like humans do - it’s more alien-minded than most. Until a few
generations ago, the Dahan carefully propitiated it only at a distance,
steering as clear as they could. But during the Years of the Relentless Sun,
it shaded large swaths of the island, averting catastrophe; since then, many
Dahan have been willing to carefully - and cautiously - heed its words,
feeling they have a debt they ought to try to repay.
* Play Style:
Good at causing Fear and picking off lone Explorers and Towns, containing the
Invaders. Not so good at massive damage - may need to rely on allies to handle
thoroughly colonized lands.
The ability to boost Range gives more flexibility to Range 0 Powers, and can be
important in larger games.
