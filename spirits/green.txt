A SPREAD OF RAMPANT GREEN
* Complexity: Moderate
* Flavor
One of the older spirits on the island, though it’s even more wild and
exuberant these days than when it was young. Contrary to some stories, it
does think things through - it’s just far more concerned with the process of
life than with things like “consequences”.

It’s not unfriendly to the Dahan, but its idea of a good time is to smother
their buildings in all manner of inconvenient greenery, and its notion of
“help” transforms carefully cultivated areas into overgrown thickets. Entire
villages have been known to move to fresh planting-sites years early if a
spirit-speaker suspects that Rampant Green is going to stay in the area for
too long.
* Play Style:
Fairly good at dealing with Towns, but terrible at handling Explorers (who are
unfazed by prolific foliage). Can get Presence onto the board faster than most other
Spirits. Extra Presence is good for targeting and especially for “Choke the Land with
Green”, which can be extremely effective at slowing down Invaders. Just be careful
not to destroy Sacred Sites needed for Power use.
* Setup
Put 2 Presence on your starting board: 1 in the highest-numbered Wetland,
and 1 in the Jungle without any Dahan. (If there is more than 1 such
Jungle, you may choose.)
* Growth:
Always: Add Presence to Jungle or Wetland, Range 2
Plus one of:
Option 1: Reclaim all; Gain Power card
Option 2: Add Presence, Range 1; +1 card play this turn
Option 3: Gain Power card; Gain 3 Energy

* Special Rules
** Choke the Land with Green
Whenever Invaders would Ravage or Build in a land with your Sacred
Site, you may prevent it by destroying one of your Presence
in that land.
** Steady Regeneration
When adding Presence to the board via Growth, you may optionally use
your destroyed Presence. If the island is Healthy, do so freely. If
the island is Blighted, doing so costs 1 Energy per destroyed Presence
you add.
