VITAL STRENGTH OF THE EARTH
* Flavor
A spirit of great and unhurried power. The life that earth yields up to roots,
the ground supporting the life that lives upon it. The patience of seasons
and of stone.
It is not usually a direct benefactor of the Dahan - rather than giving
blessings, it prefers to work in concert with them, lending power to joint
undertakings.
Currently, it is trying to rouse itself to fight against the Invaders, but this
swift and direct action runs somewhat counter to its nature.
* Play Style:
Powerful but slow: has potent Power Cards and an excellent Energy
income, but starts with only one card play per turn, and Growth is
limited to adding one Presence per turn. Also slow to change: learning
new Powers carries slightly more cost than reclaiming played Power
Cards.
* Setup
Put 3 Presence on your starting board: 2 in the highest-numbered Mountain and 1 in the highest-numbered Jungle
* Growth (Pick one)
Option 1: Reclaim all; Add Presence, Range 2
Option 2: Gain Power card; Add Presence, Range 0
Option 3: Add Presence, Range 1; Gain 2 Energy
