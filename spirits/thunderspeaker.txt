THUNDERSPEAKER
* Complexity: Moderate
* Flavor
Child of the Lightning, once known as Bright Thunder Roars in the days
when it tore across the land as an avalanche of sound and chaos. It lost
that form when the Stalker of Hidden Secrets imprisoned it in a canyon,
binding it to echo perpetually back and forth until its thunder died out or
the stones of the island wore away.

The Dahan freed it from that imprisonment. Weakened but grateful,
Bright Thunder Roars bound itself to aid the Dahan until a generation had
passed for every year of its imprisonment, and in so binding changed its
nature, becoming both less and more than it had been. It often takes
human form, now, and with centuriesâ€™ practice wears it with ease.

Chiefs call on the Thunderspeaker only in times of great need; it has not
been much seen since the destruction of the Servant Cults.
* Play Style:
Has a keen interest in where the Dahan are - partly because so many of its starting
powers work through them, partly because its Presence can move along with them.
When picking new Power Cards, it will often want to take good Dahan-centric
Powers, but it can also branch out into other areas.
* Setup
Put 2 Presence on your starting board: 1 each of the 2 lands with the
most Dahan.
