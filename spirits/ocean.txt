OCEAN'S HUNGRY GRASP
* Complexity: High
* Flavor
The hunger of the ocean runs deep and powerful, sometimes patient,
sometimes tempestuous and angry. It slowly wears away at rocky shores,
or devours half an island during a hurricane. It lures humans out onto the
water with its siren call, then consumes ship and crew alike unless the
proper offerings are made.

The oceanâ€™s voraciousness keeps the Dahan from frequent sea travel,
though they still manage a trading expedition every decade or so. These
trading-trips take the cooperation of several families, and always involve
at least two spirit-speakers. That way, even if one perishes abroad, the
expedition will still be able to get home.
* Play Style:
Extremely good at assaulting the coasts where the Invaders start out
strong, but quite weak inland - the ocean is not accustomed to
affecting events so far ashore. Its Presence shifts in and out like
the tide, which can be tricky to manage, but permits repositioning and
tactical retreats or offensives in the hands of a skillful player. Has
fairly inexpensive Unique Powers, but the energy gained from drowning
Invaders can be necessary in stepping up to more potent Powers.
* Setup
Put 2 Presence on your starting board: 1 in the Ocean, and 1 in a
Coastal land of your choice.
