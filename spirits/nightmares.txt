BRINGER OF DREAMS AND NIGHTMARES
* Complexity: High
* Flavor
When the moon is bright, and the leaves overhead are thin enough to let stray beams fall to earth, the Bringer of Dreams and Nightmares may sometimes be spied, an apparition of pale light and deep shadow. Seen this way, it will neither stop nor acknowledge attempts to communicate with it, whether by Dahan or Spirit. It might not even be there at all: perhaps it’s a reflection of a self somewhere else entirely; the realm of The Pathmaker, or some strange road that borders it.

But beings which dream hear from the Bringer frequently, even if they rarely remember it. Certain patterns may even call its attention, if drawn with sand and scattered with breath before sleep. Since the Invaders came, it has tended towards more terrifying forms, even well before the current conflict arose.
* Play Style:
With most Spirits, Terror Victories are a backup plan if the main push against the Invaders stalls out for too long, but Bringer turns Fear into a more viable primary strategy. Its transformation of damage and destruction into Fear can turn Major Powers into tremendous sources of terror and panic. However, the only real offense Bringer has is the Dahan fighting back. While it does have some defensive ability, it is fundamentally poor at clearing areas of Invaders.
* Setup
Put 2 Presence on your starting board in the highest-numbered Sands.

* Presence Tracks
** Energy

* Special Rules
** To Dream a Thousand Deaths
Your Powers never cause Damage, nor can they Destroy anything other than your own Presence.

When a Power of yours would Destroy (or deal enough Damage to Destroy) Explorer/Town/City, generate 0/2/5 Fear instead. The Power Pushes all Explorer/Town it would Destroy.

Notes: A single Power cannot Destroy a given Invader more than once. Powers which cause Damage via Dahan are affected just like all others. All effects other than Damage/Destroy work as usual.
