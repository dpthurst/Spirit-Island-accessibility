RIVER SURGES IN SUNLIGHT
* Flavor
On most of Spirit Island, the rivers run high during the rainy season, as one
would expect. There is one exception: the lingering remains of an ancient
curse keep a high ridge shrouded in ice, and when the sun beats down, it
feeds a single river with abundant meltwater.

River Surges in Sunlight is a spirit of rushing water, inundation, and
bounty out of season.

It gets along well with the Dahan who farm along its banks; they reap
the benefit of good harvests, and tend to the health of the river in
its drier times. Both gain.
* Play Style:
While capable of some direct offense, River Surges in Sunlight is best
at flooding out Explorers and Towns, displacing them from lands where
they might Build or Ravage. The ability to get free Sacred Sites makes
a wide range of Powers more useful.
