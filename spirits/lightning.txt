LIGHTNING’S SWIFT STRIKE
* Flavor
The child of a passing storm-spirit, Lightning’s Swift Strike danced off the
shores of the island many ages ago, and liked it enough to stay. It spends
much of its time resting and quiet, waking up to dance through the sky
when the winds blow strong.
It only concerns itself occasionally with the Dahan, usually appearing out
of nowhere to send them off on some obscure errand. The Dahan
cooperate — partly out of a wary respect for Lightning’s power, but as
much for the sake of the Thunderspeaker - Lightning’s child - who is a
patron and ally of their people.
* Play Style
Virtually all offense to start with: without a more defensive
teammate, Blight may become a problem. Excellent at destroying
buildings, less good at containing Explorers. Using Thundering
Destruction tends to be a burst affair: a turn or two to position and
build up Energy, followed by a really big turn. Starting Powers are
extremely focused on Air and Fire: good for Thundering Destruction,
bad for Major Power versatility.
